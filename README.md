# V1EstimationTool #

The VersionOne Estimation Tool allows you to easily divide VersionOne items into an arbitrary number of groupings or "buckets" and then apply estimate values to all of the items based on which bucket it is in.

This product includes software developed at VersionOne (http://versionone.com/). This product is open source and is licensed under a modified BSD license, which reflects our intent that software built with a dependency on the V1EstimationTool can be commercial or open source, as the authors see fit.
